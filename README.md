# Chocolate Challenge  

Version 0.0.1 :: Prototype first iteration

This project uses Angular version 17.0.9.

## How to run this example

`node -v` should be at least 18.x.x

Use `npm install` to install the dependencies

Run `ng serve` for a dev server
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests

Navigate to `localhost:4200`

Note: If you have multiple Anglular Apps running, you might need to change the port number.

Therefore there are a few things that are not yet implemented, but should be 
added later.

## TODO: 

- [ ] Setup production environment once the backend is ready
- [ ] Add a spinner when the data is being loaded in `app.component.html`
- [ ] Use a nicer UI framework like AdminLTE when the visuals get more complex
- [ ] Add routing to the app, when it is needed
