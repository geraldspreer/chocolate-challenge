# Chocolate Challenge  

Version 0.1.0 :: Prototype first iteration

This project uses Angular version 17.0.9.

## How to run this example

`node -v` should be at least 18.x.x.  

Use `npm install` to install the dependencies.  

Run `ng serve` to start the dev server.  
I have added a couple of unit-tests - use `ng test` to run them.  

Navigate to `localhost:4200`

Note: If you have multiple Anglular apps running, you will need to use another port number.

Therefore, here are a few things that are not yet implemented, but should be added later.

## TODO: 

- [ ] Setup production environment once the backend is ready, set apiUrl in `environment.prod.ts`
- [ ] Add unit tests to all components
- [ ] Implement pagination
- [ ] Add a functon to show / hide all details
- [ ] Add a spinner when the data is being loaded in `app.component.html`
- [ ] Use a nicer UI framework like AdminLTE when the visuals get more complex
- [ ] Add routing to the app, when it is needed
